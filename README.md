### 🧠 About Me

Hi there, and thank you for visiting my profile!  

I'm **Najeebullah**, a **Freelance Data Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Python, SQL, and Cloud Data Platforms**.  
My journey began as a **Data Entry Specialist (2021–2023)** on Fiverr. During that time, I discovered my passion for **data engineering and AI**—inspired by **Andrew Ng’s data-centric AI philosophy**, which emphasizes the power of well-engineered data in building smarter AI systems.  

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering**, where I first learned **C++**, which later accelerated my transition into Python and SQL for data engineering.  

I’ve since developed expertise in building scalable **data pipelines**, **data transformation workflows**, and **modern data lake architectures** using both open-source and cloud-native tools.

### 🔧 Hands-On Expertise

- **Data Pipeline Design** – from source ingestion to warehouse  
- **ETL / ELT Development** – using Airflow, dbt-core, and Python  
- **Data Modeling** – dimensional, normalized, and modern data stack  
- **Open Table Formats** – working with Delta Lake, Iceberg & Hudi  
- **Debugging & Optimization** – fixing and tuning existing data workflows  

---

### 🚀 Current Focus

I'm currently experimenting with **Delta Lake Open Table Format** on **Databricks Free Edition**, inspired by announcements from the **Databricks Data + AI Summit 2025**.  
Since **Delta Lake**, **Apache Iceberg**, and **Hudi** share many core principles, I’m deepening my understanding of their interoperability and performance tuning for scalable data lakes.

---

### 💡 Vision

I’m exploring the intersection of **data engineering, artificial intelligence, and business intelligence** — ensuring high-quality, reliable data that powers smarter decisions and enhances AI model performance.
